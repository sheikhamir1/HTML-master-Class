HTML paragraphs are blocks of text that always start on a new line, with automatic spacing added by browsers before and after them.

1. Paragraph Example
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
The <p> element defines a paragraph.

2. Display & Spacing
Extra spaces or lines in the HTML code are ignored by browsers. The browser condenses the content into a single line.
<p>
This paragraph contains     extra spaces and lines,
but the browser ignores them.
</p>

3. Horizontal Rules (<hr>)
The <hr> tag defines a horizontal rule (thematic break) to separate content and indicate a change.
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
<hr> is an empty tag with no closing tag.

4. Line Breaks (<br>)
The <br> element creates a line break without starting a new paragraph.
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
<br> is also an empty tag without a closing tag.

5. Preformatted Text (<pre>)
The <pre> element preserves spaces and line breaks, displaying text in a fixed-width font.
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
