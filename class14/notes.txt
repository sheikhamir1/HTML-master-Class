Introduction:
The <picture> element provides flexibility in displaying different images based on the device or screen size. It allows for more efficient image selection, optimizing performance and user experience.

HTML <picture> Element:
The <picture> element is used to offer multiple image sources, allowing the browser to choose the most appropriate one based on the device or screen size. It includes:

One or more <source> elements with different image resources specified via the srcset attribute.
A fallback <img> element for browsers that do not support the <picture> element or for situations where none of the sources match.

Example (Different images for different screen sizes):

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
  <img src="img_girl.jpg">
</picture>
Note: Always include an <img> element as the last child of <picture>. It serves as a fallback for browsers that do not support <picture> or if none of the <source> elements match.

When to Use the <picture> Element:
There are two key reasons to use the <picture> element:

1. Bandwidth Optimization:
For small screens or devices, loading large images is unnecessary. The browser selects the first <source> element with matching attributes and ignores the rest, reducing bandwidth usage.
2. Format Support:
Not all browsers and devices support all image formats. With <picture>, you can provide multiple formats, and the browser will choose the first one it supports.

Example (Format Support):
This example demonstrates how the browser selects the first format it supports:

<picture>
  <source srcset="img_avatar.png">
  <source srcset="img_girl.jpg">
  <img src="img_beatles.gif" alt="Beatles" style="width:auto;">
</picture>
Note: The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attributes, ignoring any following ones.

Exercise:
Question: One of these is NOT a legal HTML element. Which one is it?

<image>
<picture>
<source>
HTML Image Tags:
<img>: Defines an image.
<picture>: Defines a container for multiple image resources.
For more HTML tags, refer to the HTML Tag Reference.

Chapter Summary:
The <picture> element enables developers to specify different images for different devices and screen sizes.
Use the <source> element to specify multiple image resources.
Always include an <img> element as a fallback for unsupported browsers or unmatched source tags.
Use the <picture> element to optimize image loading for bandwidth and format compatibility.
