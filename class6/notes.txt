HTML comments are useful for adding notes or documentation to your HTML code. They are not displayed in the browser but help organize and explain code.

1. Comment Syntax
The syntax for an HTML comment is:
<!-- Write your comments here -->
The comment starts with <!-- and ends with -->.

2. Adding Comments
Comments can be used to add notes or reminders in the code without affecting the browser's output.
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Remember to add more information here -->

3. Hiding Content
You can use comments to hide parts of your code, which is helpful when you want to temporarily remove content without deleting it.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- <p>This is another paragraph</p> -->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
Everything between <!-- and --> is hidden.

4. Hiding Sections of HTML
You can hide multiple lines or sections of code.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>
Useful for debugging by temporarily removing sections to identify errors.

5. Hiding Inline Content
You can also hide content within a line of HTML.
<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>


Chapter Summary:
