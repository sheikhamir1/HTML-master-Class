Introduction:
In HTML tables, you can control both the padding inside cells and the spacing between cells using CSS properties. This helps in making tables more readable and visually appealing.

Cell Padding:
Cell padding refers to the space between the cell's edges and its content. By default, cell padding is set to 0, but it can be adjusted using the padding property in CSS.

Example:
Setting padding for all sides:


th, td {
  padding: 15px;
}

This will add 15 pixels of padding inside each cell of the table.

Example:
Setting padding for individual sides:


th, td {
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
  padding-left: 30px;
  padding-right: 40px;
}

In this example, each side of the cell content has a different padding value:

10px on the top,
20px on the bottom,
30px on the left,
40px on the right.
Cell Spacing:
Cell spacing is the space between the cells in a table. By default, the space between cells is 2 pixels. You can adjust the spacing using the border-spacing property on the table element.

Example:
Changing the spacing between table cells:


table {
  border-spacing: 30px;
}

This will set a 30-pixel space between each table cell.

By adjusting padding and spacing, you can control how content is positioned within the cells and the overall table layout, improving both the design and readability of your HTML tables.
