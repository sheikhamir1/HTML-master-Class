HTML Introduction: HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page and uses elements to label parts like headings, paragraphs, and links.

Example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
Explanation:

<!DOCTYPE html> defines the document as HTML5.
<html> is the root of the HTML page.
<head> contains meta information.
<title> sets the page title.
<body> contains visible content.
<h1> defines a large heading.
<p> defines a paragraph.
HTML Elements: HTML elements are defined by start and end tags.
Example 1:


<h1>My First Heading</h1>
Example 2:


<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Example 3:


<br>
Explanation:

Elements start with an opening tag and end with a closing tag.
Some, like <br>, are empty and don't have a closing tag.

closeing nahi hota hai sath he content bhi nahi hota hai usko empty tag ya element kehte hai

Web Browsers: Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) interpret HTML documents and display the content based on the tags but do not show the tags themselves.

Example 1:


<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Example 3:
