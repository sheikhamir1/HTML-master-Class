HTML headings are used to create titles and subtitles on a webpage. They are defined using the <h1> to <h6> tags, with <h1> being the most important and <h6> the least important.

1. Heading Example
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
<h1> is for the main heading.
<h6> is for the least important heading.

2. Headings & Structure
Headings are important for SEO (search engine optimization) as they help search engines index content and structure. Users also rely on headings to quickly navigate a page. Use headings in a logical hierarchy (e.g., <h1> for the main title, <h2> for subsections).

3. Styling Headings
The size of headings can be customized using the style attribute with the CSS font-size property.

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

4. Tips
Use headings only for structuring content, not just for making text big or bold.
Browsers automatically add margin around headings for spacing.
