What is the HTML <head> Element?
The <head> element is a container for metadata and is placed between the <html> and <body> tags.
Metadata includes information like the document title, styles, character set, scripts, and other meta information.
Metadata is not displayed on the webpage.
Elements Inside the <head> Element
The <head> element typically contains the following elements:

<title> Element

Defines the title of the document. This title appears in the browser's title bar or page tab.
The <title> element is required in HTML documents and is crucial for search engine optimization (SEO).
Example: Defining a Page Title


<html>
<head>
  <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  The content of the document...
</body>
</html>


<style> Element
Used to define CSS styles for a single HTML page, allowing inline style definitions.
Example: Adding Styles with <style>


<style>
  body { background-color: powderblue; }
  h1 { color: red; }
  p { color: blue; }
</style>

<link> Element
Used to link external resources, like stylesheets, to the document. Most commonly used for linking CSS.
Example: Linking an External Stylesheet


<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

<meta> Element
Provides metadata about the HTML document. Common uses include specifying the character set, page description, keywords, author, and viewport settings.
Metadata is used by browsers and search engines for tasks like page rendering or indexing.
Examples of <meta> Tags:


<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Viewport Settings with <meta>

The viewport is the visible area of a webpage and varies with different devices.
Setting the viewport helps make webpages responsive across different devices like mobiles and desktops.
Example: Setting Viewport for Responsive Design


<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

}
</script>
