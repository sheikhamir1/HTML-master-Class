HTML Semantic Elements

Semantic elements are HTML elements that carry meaning both for the browser and for developers. They describe the content inside them, making it more accessible and easier to understand.

What are Semantic Elements?
Semantic elements clearly define their purpose and the type of content they contain, unlike non-semantic elements such as <div> or <span>, which do not convey any meaning about their content.

Examples of Semantic Elements:
<form>
<table>
<article>
Examples of Non-Semantic Elements:
<div>
<span>
Common Semantic Elements in HTML
Websites often use semantic elements like <nav>, <header>, and <footer> to indicate navigation, headers, and footers. These elements make the structure of the page more meaningful.

Some Common HTML5 Semantic Elements:
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
HTML <section> Element
The <section> element is used to group content thematically. Each section should ideally have a heading to describe its content.

Example:


<section>
  <h1>WWF</h1>
  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on conservation, research, and restoration of the environment.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>WWF's Panda Symbol</h1>
  <p>The panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi, transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in 1961.</p>
</section>
HTML <article> Element
The <article> element represents a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed independently, like blog posts, news articles, or comments.

Example:


<article>
  <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
  <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. It's the world's most popular web browser today.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
  <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. It has been the second most popular web browser since 2018.</p>
</article>
Styling <article> Elements with CSS
You can style the <article> element for better presentation.

Example:


<html>
<head>
<style>
.all-browsers {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 5px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
.all-browsers > h1, .browser {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}
.browser {
  background: white;
}
.browser > h2, p {
  margin: 4px;
  font-size: 90%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<article class="all-browsers">
  <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>
  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. It’s the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
  </article>
  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
    <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since 2018.</p>
  </article>
</article>

</body>
</html>
HTML <header> Element
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or navigation links. It typically includes heading elements, logos, or other header information.

Example:


<article>
  <header>
    <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
  </header>
  <p>WWF’s mission is to stop the degradation of our planet’s natural environment and build a future where humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article>

HTML <footer> Element
The <footer> element defines the footer of a document or section. It usually contains metadata about the document such as authorship, copyright, or related links.

Example:


<footer>
  <p>Author: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:hege@example.com">hege@example.com</a></p>
</footer>
HTML <nav> Element
The <nav> element is used to group major navigation links.

Example:


<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav>
HTML <aside> Element
The <aside> element defines content indirectly related to the main content, often used for sidebars or additional info.

Example:


<aside>
  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
  <p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring attractions and events.</p>
</aside>
HTML <figure> and <figcaption> Elements
The <figure> element represents self-contained content like images or diagrams, while <figcaption> provides a caption for that content.

Example:


<figure>
  <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
  <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
</figure>

Why Use Semantic Elements?
Using semantic elements helps search engines and other tools better understand the structure and content of web pages. This improves accessibility, SEO, and makes code easier to maintain.
