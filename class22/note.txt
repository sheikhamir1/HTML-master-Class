Introduction:
HTML lists are used to group related items together. There are three types of lists in HTML: unordered lists, ordered lists, and description lists.

Unordered HTML List:
An unordered list (<ul>) is a list where the items are displayed with bullets by default.

Example: Unordered list

<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
Each item in the list is wrapped in an <li> tag, and the list itself is enclosed in a <ul> tag. The bullets are small black circles by default, but you can customize them with CSS.

Ordered HTML List:
An ordered list (<ol>) is a list where items are numbered.

Example: Ordered list

<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
In this case, the list items will be marked with numbers, and the sequence will continue automatically for each item.

HTML Description Lists:
A description list (<dl>) is used for listing terms and their descriptions.

The <dt> tag defines the term.
The <dd> tag defines the description of the term.
Example: Description list

<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>
This creates a list where the terms and their descriptions are listed together.

HTML List Tags:
<ul>: Defines an unordered list (bulleted list).
<ol>: Defines an ordered list (numbered list).
<li>: Defines a list item.
<dl>: Defines a description list.
<dt>: Defines a term in a description list.
<dd>: Describes a term in a description list.
By using these different types of lists, you can structure your HTML content in an organized and meaningful way.
