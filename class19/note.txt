Introduction:
HTML tables can include headers for both rows and columns. Headers are defined using the <th> element, which stands for table header.

Defining Table Headers:
Headers in HTML tables are defined using the <th> element. Each <th> element represents a header cell, which typically appears in the first row of a table.

Example:
Creating headers for columns:


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this example, "Firstname," "Lastname," and "Age" are column headers.

Vertical Table Headers:
You can use the first column as a set of headers by placing the <th> element in the first cell of each row.

Example:
Creating headers for rows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Eve</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <td>94</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here, the first column serves as the header, with "Firstname," "Lastname," and "Age" acting as row headers.

Aligning Table Headers:
By default, table headers are bold and centered. You can modify this alignment using CSS.

Example:
Left-aligning table headers:


th {
  text-align: left;
}
This CSS will align the text in all header cells to the left.

Header for Multiple Columns:
A header can span across two or more columns using the colspan attribute in the <th> element.

Example:
Header spanning two columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this example, "Name" spans two columns, with "Firstname" and "Lastname" under it.

Table Caption:
A caption can be added to a table to serve as a heading for the entire table. The <caption> tag is placed directly after the opening <table> tag.

Example:
Adding a caption to a table:


<table style="width:100%">
  <caption>Monthly savings</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Month</th>
    <th>Savings</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>January</td>
    <td>$100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>February</td>
    <td>$50</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this example, "Monthly savings" is the table's caption.

By using the <th> element and features like colspan and <caption>, you can create well-structured and accessible tables in HTML.
