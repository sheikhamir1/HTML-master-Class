Introduction:
A favicon is a small icon displayed next to the page title in a browser tab. It enhances the visibility of a website and adds a professional touch.

How to Add a Favicon in HTML:
You can use any image as a favicon, or create your own using online tools such as favicon.cc.
Tip: Since favicons are small, use a simple image with high contrast for better visibility.
The favicon appears to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

Steps to Add a Favicon:
Save the Favicon:

Save your favicon image either in the root directory of your webserver or in a folder (commonly named "images") within the root directory.
The common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".
Add the Favicon to HTML:

In your HTML file (index.html), add the <link> element after the <title> element.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Save and Reload:
After saving your index.html file, reload the page in your browser. You should now see the favicon next to the page title in the browser tab.
