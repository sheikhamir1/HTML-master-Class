Introduction:
HTML tables allow web developers to organize and present data in rows and columns. They are useful for displaying structured information clearly and concisely.

Example of an HTML Table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Contact</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alfreds Futterkiste</td>
    <td>Maria Anders</td>
    <td>Germany</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Centro comercial Moctezuma</td>
    <td>Francisco Chang</td>
    <td>Mexico</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This table lists company names, their contacts, and their respective countries.

Defining an HTML Table:
An HTML table is composed of table cells, arranged into rows and columns.

Each row is defined by the <tr> (table row) element.
Each cell is defined by the <td> (table data) element, where the actual content is placed.

Example of Table Cells:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: Table cells can hold any HTML element such as text, images, lists, links, or even another table.
Table Rows:
Each row in an HTML table begins with <tr> and ends with </tr>.

Example of Table Rows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can add as many rows as needed, ensuring that each row has the same number of cells for a uniform table structure.

Table Headers:
Table headers are used to define column headings, and are represented using the <th> element instead of <td>. Header cells are often bold and centered by default.

Example of Table Headers:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Person 1</th>
    <th>Person 2</th>
    <th>Person 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Emil</td>
    <td>Tobias</td>
    <td>Linus</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: The default style for <th> includes bold text that is centered. This can be customized using CSS.
