HTML Links - Hyperlinks:
Links are essential for navigating web pages and are represented by hyperlinks.
You can click on a hyperlink to jump to another document or page.
Links can be applied to text, images, or other HTML elements.
HTML Link Syntax:
The basic syntax for creating a hyperlink in HTML uses the <a> tag:


<a href="url">link text</a>
href: The most important attribute, defining the URL or location of the link destination.
Link Text: The clickable part, visible to users.

Example:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

Unvisited link: Blue and underlined.
Visited link: Purple and underlined.
Active link: Red and underlined.
HTML Links - The target Attribute:

By default, clicking a link opens the page in the same window/tab. Use the target attribute to change this behavior.

Common values for target:

_self: Default, opens the link in the same window.
_blank: Opens the link in a new tab/window.
_parent: Opens the link in the parent frame.
_top: Opens the link in the entire window.

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs:
Absolute URL: The full web address, starting with "https://".
Relative URL: A shorter path, linking to files within the same website.

Examples:

<!-- Absolute URL -->
<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>

<!-- Relative URL -->
<a href="/html_images.asp">HTML Images</a>
Use an Image as a Link:
You can use an image as a clickable link by embedding an <img> tag inside an <a> tag.

Example:

<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

Link to an Email Address:
Using the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute, you can create a link that opens the user's default email program.

Example:

<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

Button as a Link:
You can make a button function as a link by adding JavaScript to the button’s onclick event.

Example:

<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>
Link Titles:
The title attribute specifies extra information, often shown as a tooltip when you hover over the link.

Example:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>

More on Absolute and Relative URLs:
Example (Absolute URL):

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>
Example (Relative URL - page in the same folder):

<a href="default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>

Use the <a> tag to define hyperlinks.
Use the href attribute to specify the link’s destination.
Use the target attribute to control where the link opens.
